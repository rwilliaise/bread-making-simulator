                                   GRAND PLAN

  Introduction

    Bread Making Simulator III is a game about making bread for God. The basic
    process to create bread is the following:

 Collect wheat -> Smash wheat into flour -> Wash flour into dough -> Cook dough
                         into bread -> Serve God bread

    Wheat can be grown on grasslands. Flour can be first created in the players
    inventory by utilizing an interactive UI to smash the wheat material into
    flour material. Dough can be created by putting flour in water 

  Technology Tree

    There will be several tiers of technology, which correspond to certain
    points in the game, such as early-game, late-game, and so on. The stages of
    the game correlate to your relationship with God.

    The tiers are defined as follows:

      1 BREAD
