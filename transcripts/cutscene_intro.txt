LINE (seperate recordings):

1: Hey it's me God. I've been feelin' hungry. So I made you to make me bread. I
   mean I could've just summoned the bread, but you know how the saying goes.

  "Give a man fish, he eats for one day. Teach a man to fish, I eat every day"
                                                                           - God

So uhh. I made some wheat for you.

                  [ waits for player to interact with wheat ]

2: Oh wait I forgot you gotta crush the wheat... ok just try punching it I guess.

                 [ waits for player to crush wheat into flour ]

3: Wow that is gross holy moly. I'm glad I don't have taste buds. Ok now find
water and make dough.

               [ waits for player to saturate flour into dough ]

4: Ok, now I will summon a fire. Just like roast the dough I don't know.

                       [ waits for player to make bread ]

5: Okay cool thanks dawg.

                  [ bread disappears in a flash of lightning ]
                        [ player is dropped into world ]

You know how the saying goes.

 "Give a man a fire, he roasts bread for one day. Set a man on fire, he roasts
                        bread for the rest of his life."
                                                                           - God
